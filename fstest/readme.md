# FS Test

## Overview

Code to test IFS / FWFS operation running under development OS. At present consists of an Eclipse project for MinGW (Windows), however the code is intended to be POSIX compliant so porting should be possible.

## Status

At present code requires portions of the Sming framework to compile but it is intended to remove that dependency for a simpler build.
